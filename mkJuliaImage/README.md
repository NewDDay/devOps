This tgbot contain 5 parts
1) The Telegram bot. In the v0.1 it is simplest bot with only 2 functions: \help and \roll
2) The Julia v1.7.0. It is my favorite program language. Yes, I know that downloading julia client and install into docker image it is not professional. I know that in docker there are layer functionality and in the future I will use layers. But now I download and install into docker image julia portable client.
3) Dockerfile. It is my first Dockerfile. I wrote it myself.
4) I want become devOps, so I did bash install file
5) In this directory there are .env file. It should look like # .env
